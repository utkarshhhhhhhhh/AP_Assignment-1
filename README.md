This project implements a Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as Classes, Objects, Encapsulation & Class Relationships. The system provides functionalities for both librarians and members (students) to manage books and memberships efficiently. The application includes features such as adding/removing books, registering/removing members, issuing/returning books, calculating fines, and more.
